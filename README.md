# Movie-Recommender

### Why depend on the OTT platforms when you can have your own Movie Recommender? üë®üèª‚Äçüíª

I have developed this Recommendation engine on the TMDB dataset using Python programming language. After doing the pre-processing, I have used Cosine Similarity to find the movie recommendations. Finally, for the UI part, I have used Streamlit. 

## Steps to Replicate:
<i>1. Fork this repository.<br>
2. Install the required libraries from requirements.txt using ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.<br>
3. Open the app.py file.<br>
4. Replace <YOUR_API_KEY> with your own API key from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and save the file.<br>
5. Open python terminal and run ```streamlit run app.py```.<br>
6. Don't forget to give a Star. This will motivate me to upload more projects in future.</i><br>
